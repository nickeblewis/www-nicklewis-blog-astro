Inbox zero, that's what we will be talking about today.
There's nothing worse than getting behind your laptop and seeing an inbox that's unmaintainable.

The best habit I've ever started is inbox zero.

It not only makes your life easier, but actually gives you more peace and a clearer mind!

Today I'll guide you through this, and we are using this flowchart I made for you!

## Don't overdo yourself

When starting to commit to inbox zero, don't overdo yourself.
When I began my inbox zero, I know I had thousands of emails, and I just moved ALL emails to "archive".

That was a relieve, and we can always search if we need one.

So let's start with that today

> Move all your mails to archive

## Inbox zero policies

The policy for inbox zero is different for everyone. This is my one:

- Mail comes in
- Is it a mailing list -> read/move to archive
- Is it spam -> delete
- Is it important and needs follow up ðŸ‘‡
- Can I reply right away? -> Reply -> else ðŸ‘‡
- Make a task for it and move to archive

With these simple steps, you'll always have a zero inbox and a clear mind.

Even when I come back from a holiday, I only need an hour max to go through my mailbox and perhaps make some tasks I can assign overtime.

### Pro-tip for newsletters

If your the person like me that's subscribed to many newsletters, evaluate every time you open one:

- Do I actually ever read these?
- Do I still resonate with this newsletter?

If the answer is No -> Unsubscribe

## Don't stress it

One important thing is not to stress about having a zero inbox all the time. It's about balance and enjoying life.
If you want to keep your focus, close your mail application and focus on other things.
There's always tomorrow to get to zero again.

What is your best tip for inbox zero?
