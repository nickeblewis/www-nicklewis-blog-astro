On Fridays during August we have the afternoon off, so that we can spend more time with our families outdoors and step away from our desks. I chose to go for a photo walk and I shall do the same for the next few weeks and hope to find a whole bunch of new places to explore along the way.

The title gives the game away here! I chose to take a walk around the Roman Wall at Silchester, the entire circuit, carrying a bottle of water, as the temperature was a chilly 23 Celsius, compared to near 30 today.

The scene reminded me of foreign climes, which these days, seem more familiar than ever before with every, field, garden and park looking as parched as the desert. You see landscapes like this in all of the hot places,Spain perhaps but in those cases you would most likely see more goats than sheep!

The last photo in this set, is of the same tree and section of the wall that I photographed in November 2021 when it was bare and the landscape looked very different.
