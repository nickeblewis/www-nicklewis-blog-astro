On Fridays during August we have the afternoon off, so that we can spend more time with our families outdoors and step away from our desks. I chose to go for a photo walk and I shall do the same for the next few weeks and hope to find a whole bunch of new places to explore along the way.

The title gives the game away here! I chose to take a walk around the Roman Wall at Silchester, the entire circuit, carrying a bottle of water, as the temperature was a chilly 23 Celsius, compared to near 30 today.

Calleva Atrebatum was an Iron Age oppidum, the capital of the Atrebates tribe. It then became a walled town in the Roman province of Britannia at a major crossroads of the Roman roads of Britain. The modern village of Silchester in Hampshire, England, is about a mile to the west of the site.

Looking for perspectives in photography leads to many different possibilities, as I had tried the other angle where you look along the pews but that hadn't worked in this case. So I tried this angle, I wanted to pick up on the prayer cushions.

It is documented that this 12th Century Christian church was built on a pagan site and prior to that, some 1100 years beforehand would have been part of Roman Silchester. Some of the materials used to build the church were borrowed from the nearby Roman wall.

## Waking the Roman Wall

The scene reminded me of foreign climes, which these days, seem more familiar than ever before with every, field, garden and park looking as parched as the desert. You see landscapes like this in all of the hot places,Spain perhaps but in those cases you would most likely see more goats than sheep!

Looking out across this field, I imagined how it must have looked as a town. There have been many excavations on this site since the Victorians began digging places up from Hadrian's Wall down to Herculaneum, Italy. My Wife and I once came across a dig that was taking place on the far side of the field pictured above. It was very fascinating. I can recall it being a hot summer much like this one, they had a number of gantries set up across trenches where walls and streets could be seen. Just small sections of them, as the Archaelogical team are given an area so big to measure out and down they dig. A little bit of poetry there for you!

Many of the finds can be seen at Reading museum, if you get the chance to go, do go, look out for the Eagle!

The last photo in this set, is of the same tree and section of the wall that I photographed in November 2021 when it was bare and the landscape looked very different.
