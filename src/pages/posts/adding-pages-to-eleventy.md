Someone made an excellent comment recently that an about page would benefit my blog quite a bit.

So why not explore how to add static pages to our dynamic created blog at the same time.

We are going to create a static about page, which is going to sit on the URL `/about`.

## Adding the About page

Create a `about.njk` file in the root at the same level as the `index.njk` and insert the following code:

```html
---
layout: layouts/about.njk
permalink: /about/
---

<img src="/img/about.jpg" height="300" />

<h1>Hello world, I'm Chris! ðŸ¤Ÿ</h1>

  beatiful girlfriend and dog.

<p></p>
<p>
  I come from a mixed background being a full stack WordPress developer, a PHP
  Symfony developer and just your good old fullstack dev.
</p>
<p>

  fast and innovative.

```

Here you see we set the layout to a new layout, and add a permalink to `/about/` this will actually create a `about` folder with a `index.html` inside of it.

Then we add an image and some text.

## Images in Eleventy

The image we just added won't work by default. We have to tell Eleventy to put it in our output folder.

We can add a `.eleventy` file in our root, and let's add the following code in it.

```js
module.exports = function (eleventyConfig) {
  // Copy `img/` to `_site/img`
  eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy('img');
};
```

Here we can change the default Eleventy settings; in this case, we say it must just the `addPassthroughCopy` function to add the `img` folder to our output.

That being said, create the `img` folder in the root of our website and add your profile image in it as we set in the `about.njk` page!

## The About template

```html
---
layout: layouts/base.njk
templateClass: tmpl-about
---

{{ content | safe }}
```

This layout is the same as our homepage, we could have re-used that one, but I like to keep things separate in case we want to add anything fancy later on.

## Testing and Deploying Netlify

As we saw in [building a static blog with 11ty](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/building-a-static-blog-with-11ty/) we can run the following command to test it locally:

```bash
npx eleventy --serve
```

The open up [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see what we got!

To deploy to Netlify we can use our learnings from [Hosting on Netlify](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/hosting-a-static-blog-on-netlify/) and push to our git master branch.

You can find this code in the following [GitHub repo](https://github.com/rebelchris/eleventy-demo/releases/tag/2.0), or view it online on [this link](https://romantic-torvalds-af350e.netlify.app/about/).
