We are getting into a great habit of going for a morning walk around 7am or just before. Today we followed the river Blackwater for a stretch which also marks the boundary between Hampshire and Surrey. #write52

Lovely old Victorian wrought iron work nonetheless.

The path is also very close to the A331 and it was noticeably busier this morning. Mind you the birds in the trees that lined the route were competing with the noise of the traffic. A fascinating cacophony.
