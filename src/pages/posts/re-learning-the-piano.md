Back in 2020, yeah, that crazy year, we all started knitting, baking and for some, such as me, got back into old hobbies that we'd neglected for some time. In our loft, sitting dormant for a good 20 years, was my Yamaha CS2X, a classic 90's keyboard synth I must have bought in 1998 around the time I was learning to play both the guitar and keys. The latter turning out to be my forte. I later purchased some other studio gear including an Akai sampler, audio interfaces, mixer, MINIdisc system to record my ideas onto and I got into Cubase and Cakewalk.

I then sold a lot of the stuff, because I was moving out of my parents house and was a bit skint, however I kept the Yamaha!

I regret selling things sometimes and wander how much fun I would have had with the older gear if I still had it now but anyway, things in technology change and in huge steps. So nowadays, all of that hardware has been shrunk down to the laptop, iPad (didn't have these in the 90s) and iPhone or indeed Android devices if you've got those instead of Apple devices.

That is where I pick up the threads of this journey. What can I create on my iPad with little to no external hardware at all. Later I will look at getting some, just one or two external devices, to create something of a hybrid setup, however I've not given it much thought yet.

I will also talk a little bit about how to share these ideas online, mostly through Soundcloud and at that point will introduce you to mine.

Anyway back to the original conversation thread. Learning something all over again, how can you go about it? How can you record your process?

## Getting set up

This is of course going to be iPad biased but you can use any keyboard you may already have, in my case it's an old Yamaha CS2x which I've connected to my iPad via an iRig 2 MIDI interface. Then for the iPad I use an OQeeM USB interface, so that the USB connector can be plugged in, plus I've got a headphone jack to listen to what I'm playing!

You could of course here, connect to an audio interface and onto some studio monitor speakers but I'll save that for the future, as those items are on my shopping list still right now.
