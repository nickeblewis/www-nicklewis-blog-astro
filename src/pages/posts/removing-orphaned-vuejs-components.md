Whilst refactoring a VueJS project today, I became aware that we've got quite a lot of component files, knowing that some are no longer needed, surplus to our needs. The thing is, how could I identify them? I could go through each file, scroll down to the imports section and find out that way, but to be honest, what a long winded way of going about it, especially in a project of this size. 

I had a look around and came across a handy NPM tool that you can install globally.

```bash
npm install vue-unused-components-checker -g

```

Then navigate to the folder where your project resides and issue the following command:

```bash
check-unused-comp .
```

Low and behold it listed the files I probably needed to delete from my project or refactor in some way.

You can also search specific directories within your project and limit the output to a certain number etc.

[Install the tool via NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-unused-components-checker)
