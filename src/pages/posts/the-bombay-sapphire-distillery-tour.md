Now, let's cut to the chase, I love Gin, never used to but then one day my parents made me a gin cocktail when I went to visit them and it was blimmin lovely. The following year my wife bought for my birthday a years Gin Club membership, where 
I received a new Gin every few weeks, together with a magazine, some snacks, a few mixers and sometimes star annise, lemon peel to further embellish your sumptious cocktail. It was a lot of fun and I came across some great products along the way.

Now when we go out and I order a G&T or if we are staying at a hotel for example, I normally opt for Bombay Sapphire, it's just one of my favourites. So it was a real delight earlier this year to be given for my birthday a tour gift by some friends of ours. 
A tour of their distillery which isn't all that far from where we live.
