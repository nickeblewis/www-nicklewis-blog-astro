Now, let's cut to the chase, I love Gin, never used to but then one day my parents made me a gin cocktail when I went to visit them and it was blimmin lovely. The following year my wife bought for my birthday a years Gin Club membership, where 
I received a new Gin every few weeks, together with a magazine, some snacks, a few mixers and sometimes star annise, lemon peel to further embellish your sumptious cocktail. It was a lot of fun and I came across some great products along the way.

Now when we go out and I order a G&T or if we are staying at a hotel for example, I normally opt for Bombay Sapphire, it's just one of my favourites. So it was a real delight earlier this year to be given for my birthday a tour gift by some friends of ours. 
A tour of their distillery which isn't all that far from where we live.

As you arrive at the former Paper Mill, formerly owned by the Portal family, it's clearly a big distillery with a number of beautiful Grade II listed buidlings forming it's footprint right on the banks of the River Test. Incidentally the River isn't used or 
touched in any way. The buildings have been around for a very long time and as we later learnt, had been standing derelict for a long time. That was until Bacardi, Bombay Sapphire's parent company were looking for a new site and they moved here from Warrington.

The reception area is very impressive with high vaulted ceilings, artwork, video screens promoting their latest products and a very friendly team.

THe tour starts with an empty glass, a choice of three different gins, some star anise, lemon, orange and any other ingredients you want to add. What we thought was good, is that they cater for the drivers, so Tina had a lovely moctail and was given a token, to collect a gin and tonic at the end of the tour,to make up at home later.
