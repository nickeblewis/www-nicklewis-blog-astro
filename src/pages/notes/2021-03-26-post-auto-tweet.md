My blog is powered by [@eleven_ty](https:twitter.com/eleven_ty) and hosted on [@netlify](https://twitter.com/netlify). Using Netlify functions, I want to publish a tweet when a new post is published. How do I do this? Anyone have any ideas? I will try and figure out a way at some point in time and if successful, will tell you how I did it.
