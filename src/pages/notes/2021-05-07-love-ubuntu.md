I have been running Ubuntu on my work computer for around 3 months now and I absolutely love it. I am tempted to install it on my own Mac. I love MacOS but I think I may love Ubuntu a bit more, so is it worth running a dual boot? I have 1Tb that I could divide up? Or is a VM Ubuntu worth the trouble?
