Sladeâ€™s Bridge in Up Nately, Hampshire was originally built in 1790 it provided access to the Nateley Brickworks on the Northern side of the Basingstoke canal.

A little research into the brickworks was interesting - In 1895 after eight years in the hands of the official receiver, the canal was bought by Sir Frederick Seager Hunt, who formed the Woking, Aldershot & Basingstoke Canal & Navigation Company Ltd. Sir Fred was a Tory MP but made his living as a gin distiller.

It was when the Army camps in Aldershot, Deepcut and Pirbright were being upgraded, that large quantities of bricks were needed. Sir Frederick bought a small brickworks in Up Nateley, spent a lot of money on expanding it to create the Hampshire Brick and Tile Company.

A 100-yard arm was dug near Slades bridge to allow boats to load bricks and unload coal to fire the kilns. Around 50 tons of coal was transported here from Basingstoke every week, which ironically was delivered there by rail!

Eventually the business went into liquidation after a 14 week closure of the canal at Woking which impacted the business. It was also said that the clay was unsatisfactory and the bricks too poor for building work.

Does anyone know if any of the old brickworks buildings still exist?
