Today we visited the EV Experience Centre in Milton Keynes and took a good look at Volkswagen’s new ID.4 SUV. They are so spacious inside and you can really stretch out, a bonus for tall passengers! My wife and I are of average height but the people we tend to transport are always very tall!

I can’t say (yet) how the car drives but it is certainly on our list of vehicles we are considering along with:

* Tesla
* Hyundai Ioniq 5
* Kia e-Niro 
* Nissan Ariya 
* Skoda Enyaq
* Jaguar i-pace 

A number of companies will let you hire their vehicles for a few days, so that you can make an informed decision on which car is the best match for your needs.
