Over the past Year during the pandemic I've consumed even more, no not food nor booze. Podcasts! I've become a Podaholic and I do count some YouTube content in this also. Favourites are - [@tfopnow](https://twitter.com/tfopnow) as the four hosts always discuss diverse topics around the main subject. Smith and Sniff which you'll find on Spotify, in which two friends talk about cars and more often than not go of tangent in hilarious fashion. Photography Daily the brilliant creation of wedding photographer Neale James and much like Smith and Sniff, borne out of the year 2020. What else can you do when you can't shoot weddings, record TV shows etc? Well you can make a podcast! I thought about one but my main skill has turned out to be procrastination, so it never happened.
