Churches have always been a fascination and how they have become part of the British landscape. Stand on a hillside that overlooks the tapestry of fields, farms, villages and you'll always see a church spire that punctuates that view.

I am starting small (ahem). If I were to photograph every church in the United Kingdom, I would be busy for a very long time, as there are 16,000 or so. If you take a peek at my Google map below, I have started with a more manageable area but have found hundreds of churches already!

If you have a favourite near you, I would sure like to know about it.
