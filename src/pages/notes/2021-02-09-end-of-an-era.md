I will write more about this on my blog (see bio for link) but I have news. I am stepping away from contracting and freelancing. I accepted an offer on a new job yesterday which will be quite a journey from March onwards. Will remain in the front-end developer space with a nice splash of Drupal and Wordpress thrown in. Skills are PHP, Vue and React. Exciting times!
