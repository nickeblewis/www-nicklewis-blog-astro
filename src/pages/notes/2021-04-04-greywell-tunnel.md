It's fascinating what you learn as you begin digging deep into the history of a place. Clearly there are some places I have just got to go in search of. 

I know the area of the canal from Odiham Castle up to the Greywell Tunnel very well indeed. I've known it since I was a teenager. The section I've never visited though has been what lies to the west of it.

This looks useful, a set of circular walks along the entire canal but the one that interests me most of all is [Greywell Hill Park](https://www.basingstoke-canal.org.uk/bcs/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Circular-Rambles-on-the-Basingstoke-Canal.pdf) which incorporates various interesting spots.

## What3words

///drilled.unscathed.farm

I like this name because we are looking for a tunnel and it cuts underneath farmland and thus on the surface it remains unscathed!!

	- There has for a long time been an ambition to restore the last 5 miles but as you can imagine this would now be close to impossible
	- Tunnel can't be restored, due to it's SSI status
	- 300 meter section collapsed
	- Basingstoke Wharf is now (amongst many things) Festival Place 
	- [Plans to establish a footpath](https://www.basingstoke.gov.uk/content/doclib/42.pdf) and cycleway that follows closely the old route taken by the canal

	- The last boat to travel all the way to Basingstoke Wharf was thought to be February 1914 which had taken 4 months to ship its cargo of sand from Ash Vale. It had become very hard to navigate.

	- A very nice watch!

Can we find the opposite portal into the tunnel at Greywell and evidence of the part long defunct?
