I am working on a number of photography projects and I will introduce you to them as I go along throughout the year ahead. The one I wanted to talk about today is dedicated to churches. To learn more about it, here is the first post to get us started and one of the photos I share. I explain why it is important to set a project and then to apply some constraints to it!
