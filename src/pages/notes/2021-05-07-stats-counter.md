One of the tasks I had this week was to find a way of animating stats on the homepage of our company website. You know the kind of thing, you see them on quite a lot of sites. It is all about the big reveal, as the user reveals more of your content, animation brings colour and sparkle to your presentation. I had a little look around online and this Codepen certainly seems to do the trick for me. I will share the final results once we relaunch the website later this summer :-)
