I am looking at a way I can use [@netlify](https://twitter.com/netlify) functions to share a random archive post from my blog on a daily basis maybe around 4pm every day [@eleven-ty](https://twitter.com/eleven_ty) - I have a rough idea of how to achieve this and I am going to give it a go. Post will go out explaining how once I've fathomed it out.
