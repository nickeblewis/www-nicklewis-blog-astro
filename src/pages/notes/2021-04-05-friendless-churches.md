My favourite Twitter accounts, especially those with a stronger purpose than my own, are those that tell great stories. Friendless Churches are a charity who help restore the places of worship that no longer see many people, let alone hold services of any kind. They are well worth a follow, regardless of whether you make a donation or not. You may learn about somewhere not so far from you that you had never heard of before.
